## Introduction
ROS (Robot operating system) is an open source framework for getting robots to do things. It is a middleware which provides services and tools to control multiple processes.  ROS allows us to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robots.

## Getting started  

### Installation  
1. You will need a [linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) based OS. (i.e. Ubuntu,Mac OS)  
2. ROS [installation](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

### Submitting your work
To submit your work, you will have to **fork** this repository. After that you can create a clone of your fork. This is where you will push all of your work.  

## Tasks
Tasks are arranged in a weekly manner (like a MOOC)  

**Task 0:**  
1. Install your OS (Ubuntu 20.04 is preferred).  
2. Install ROS.  
   Verify your installation by running the command `roscd`  

**Task 1:**  
1. Create a catkin workspace. Go through all sub-directories and understand their significance.  
2. Create a ROS package.  
3. Launch the turtlesim node and explore its messages and topics.  
4. Publish a ROS package for a simple publisher subscriber node in python (talker-listener).  

**Task 2:**  
1. Modify the talker-listener node to send data of different types. (int,bool,char)  
2. Create a ROS node to control the turtlebot. (Move,Rotate,Go to goal)  
3. Write a script to draw the letter 'D' using the turtle bot.  
4. Write a script to draw a hexagon using the turtle bot.
